# General

- How would you visually hide an element in the UI so itâ€™s still accessible for screen readers?
  - Absolutely position an element off the screen
  - 1px width and height

## Performance

- Compress data, images, payloads (CSS, javascript)
- Reduce size of API payloads where possible
- Simplify DOM structure
- Simplify (ie: reduce specificity) of CSS structure
- Use hardware accelerated animations (those that don't cause layout) - opacity/transform
