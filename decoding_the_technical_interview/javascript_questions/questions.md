- What is the difference between const, let and var?
  - Var is hoisted to the top, let and const aren't
  - Const can't be pointed to a different bit of memory
  - Let you can change the pointer
- Explain prototypical inheritance
  - All objects inherit from their prototype - a baseline object
  - When you create a new object from its prototype you can inherit its children, or override them
- What is 'this' mean in javascript?
  - Current scope you're in which can change, but if there is no scope then it's the global context usually
  - It's the global context of everything that's available to access - all the objects and functions that are available to you that aren't locally defined
- What is the data structure of the DOM?
  - It's a tree
- What is a Stack? What is a Queue? How would you create those data structures in Javascript?
  - Stack is a list of objects that is last-in, first out. So you can push something onto a stack and pop things off the top
  - A queue is a first-in-first-out list of objects that you can enqueue and dequeue
  - You can create a stack using an array, array inherits `push` and `pop`
  - Queue, you can implement using an array, and use `push` and `shift` to dequeue
- How can you tell if an image element is loaded on a page?
  - Images have an onload callback that you can implement
- What are call() and apply()
  - Ways of executing a function with a different lexical scope and optional arguments
  - call() is a series of arguments, apply() is an array of items 
- What is event delegation?
  - When an event is bubbled up from the calling context
  - Event listeners are really expensive, so you don't want to have events firing constantly
  - Better to have one event handler and have events bubble up than have 60+
  - Performance reasons
- What is a worker? When would you use one?
  - A way to offload computationally expensive work to a different thread (JS is single-threaded, so it can block rendering, etc.)

- Can you define a promise?
  - A promise is a 

- What is a closure?
- How would you visually hide an element in the UI so it’s still accessible for screen readers?
- Why do we use alt tags for images?
- How can we make our web applications more performant?
